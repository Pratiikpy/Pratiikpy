# About Me
Hi there! I'm Prateek, a 🐍 Python enthusiast with a passion for all things 💻 digital marketing. When I'm not busy searching the internet for solutions (Google is my best friend 🤓), you can find me diving into the world of 🧠 data science and 🤖 machine learning on Simplilearn. I've also dabbled in a bit of 🐧 Linux and know my way around 🕵️‍♂️ SEO and 🎨 Canva.

# My Interests
In my spare time, I love learning about 📚 history, 🌌 astronomy, 🔬 physics, and 🙏 spirituality (especially Krishna 🙏).
